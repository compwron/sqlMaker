SqlMaker
===========

A tiny DSL for writing sql queries

Tables (table name and column names) are kept in the code as enums


Todo
===========
* date insert
* inner join
* outer join
* update x set y = z
* update x where y = z where a = b
* SELECT a1 FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.SomeID = t2.SomeID
* aliasing tables on join (will this be needed?)
